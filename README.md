# Diabetes Prediction with Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using logistic regression, leveraging key input features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age. The goal is to create a robust binary classification model that accurately identifies individuals with diabetes.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values: Ensure that any missing data is appropriately handled.
- Feature normalization: Normalize or standardize features to ensure uniform contributions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore feature distributions and relationships to gain insights into the dataset.
- Visualize key patterns and correlations.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Experiment with creating new features or transforming existing ones.
- Consider interactions between features or polynomial features.

### 4. Logistic Regression Model
- Implement logistic regression for binary classification.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
